**Current Research**

Deep learning is humanityâ€™s most successful attempt thus far to imitate human intelligence. Despite fundamental differences between deep learning systems and biological brains, deep learning remains a theoretically- and experimentally-accessible playground for understanding learning as a general phenomenon. The long-term goal of my research is to probe deep learning systems (using both theoretical tools and numerical experiments) to elucidate general properties of systems that learn.

Even as a toy model of learning, deep learning is itself mysterious in many ways. Experiments reveal many interesting behaviors (e.g. feature learning, neural scaling laws, emergent abilities) which are poorly understood from a theory standpoint. In particular, I'm interested the large-learning-rate phenomena associated with feature learning (e.g., dynamics of the local loss geometry, representation alignment, and edge-of-stability behavior) and I hope to understand why deep learning is more sample efficient than kernel machines.

**Bio**

I grew up in Texas and studied physics, astronomy, and computer science at UT Austin. I joined Berkeley as a physics PhD student in 2021, excited to use ideas from physics to understand information processing in neural networks. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, cooking, playing chess, and messing with synthesizers.
