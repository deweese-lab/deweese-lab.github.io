Bio

I am a 2nd-year PhD student in the physics program at UC Berkeley, aiming to use tools from theoretical physics to build fundamental understanding of machine learning methods. I'm advised by Mike DeWeese. In my free time, I like running, puzzles, spending time in forests, and balancing things.
