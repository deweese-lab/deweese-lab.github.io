**Current Research**

I'm interested in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and how to apply it. I currently work on optimal stochastic thermodynamics and thermodynamic geometry, and am interested in topics like the thermodynamics of computation, information engines, and the application of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to theoretical neuroscience. Philosophy is another big interest of mine outside of physics!

**Bio**

I'm originally from Seattle, and completed my undergraduate degrees in physics and philosophy as part of the University of Washington's interdisciplinary honors program. Before coming to Berkeley I moved to the UK to complete a masters degree in philosophy, as a Clarendon scholar at the University of Oxford.
