**Current Research**

My research revolves around leveraging optimal control theory to study dynamical systems far from equilibrium, with the ultimate goal of discovering thermodynamic principles that underlie biological systems.

**Bio**

Outside of science, I enjoy reading, hiking, and songwriting.
