**Current Research**

My interests lie in cyclical dynamics and out-of-equilibrium statistical mechanics. In particular, I study how biological systems perform computations and maintain energetic/entropic homeostasis through cycles in various timescales.

**Bio**

I am a DoubleBear student — I did my undergraduate in physics also at UC Berkeley, and UC Berkeley’s mascot is Oski the Bear. Outside of science, I like to read, skateboard, and dig through and discover music through the ages.
