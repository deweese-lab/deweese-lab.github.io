**Current Research**

I’m interested in neural variability: understanding its structure, its role in neural coding, and its influence on phenomenological models of functional connectivity. I also spend time thinking about bridging the gap between experimentation and theory in neuroscience.

**Bio**

I’m a graduate student in the Physics department, previously having done research in theoretical astrophysics. I enjoy running, hiking, biking, and ultimate. I also spend time working to improve equity and inclusion in the academia.
