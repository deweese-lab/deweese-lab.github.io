**Current Research**

My work to date in the group has mainly employed geometric approaches for the study of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with particular focus on optimal protocols. I am also more broadly interested in the intersection of thermodynamics and information theory with potential implications on learning processes and in the principles underpinning order and structure formation in living settings.

**Bio**

I did my undergrad in physics and math at Harvard where I did research on dynamical systems and elasticity in the group of Ariel Amir. When I arrived at Berkeley, I intended on focusing on condensed matter theory, though I got interested in questions in learning and non-eq stat mech, and so I joined the DeWeese group instead.

Outside of science, I enjoy running, cooking, hiking, and crosswords (I just wish I was good at any of them).
