**Current Research**

I study optimization in deep learning and models of auditory processing.

**Bio**

I came to Redwood through a random walk around a bunch of different fields. During my undergrad at Rice University, I got the chance to explore everything from journalism, to Spanish language, to science policy before finally deciding I wanted to focus on science. Though I finished with a degree in chemical physics, I was always interested in the brain. I got inspired to do theoretical neuroscience as an undergrad in Amina Qutub’s lab using graph theory to model the proliferation of neural progenitor cells. I chose Berkeley for Redwood’s interdisciplinary research program and the opportunity to work with others from non-traditional science backgrounds like myself.

I love jazz and hip-hop music, martial arts, traveling, and cooking.
