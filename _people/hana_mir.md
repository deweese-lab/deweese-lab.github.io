**Current Research**

I study systems far from equilibrium using optimal control theory and thermodynamic geometry with the goal of modeling biological systems and mechanisms. Currently, I am collaborating with Stephen Whitelam and Corneel Cassert at LBL to study active matter systems, which can be used to model bacterial colonies, Janus particles, herds of animals, and more.

**Bio**

I grew up in Northern Virginia and attended Virginia Tech for undergrad where I majored in physics and minored in math and philosophy, political science and economics (PPE). When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, going to concerts, and hosting "Bachelor nights" with charcuterie and knitting (:
